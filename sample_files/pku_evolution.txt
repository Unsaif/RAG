Woolf (1986) suggested that there may be a heterozygous advantage in PKU which operates through protection against the toxic effects of ochratoxin A. This mycotoxin is produced by several species of Aspergillus and Penicillium infesting stored grains and other foods. The mild, wet climate of Ireland and West Scotland tends to encourage the growth of molds. Furthermore, these areas have suffered repeated famines during which moldy food was eaten. Heterozygous women appear to have a lower spontaneous abortion rate.
