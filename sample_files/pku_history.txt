Folling (1934) in Norway first described PKU under the designation oligophrenica phenylpyruvica. Jervis (1947) localized the metabolic error as an inability to oxidize phenylalanine to tyrosine, and Jervis (1953) demonstrated deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase in the liver of a patient. 

Guthrie (1996) gave a history of his introduction of newborn screening for PKU. A shift in his research from cancer research to the study of mental retardation had been prompted by the birth of his second child with mental retardation. He learned that the phenylalanine-restricted diet introduced for treatment of PKU required close monitoring of blood Phe levels for which the methods were then laborious. He conceived of modifying the bacterial test he was using to screen for different substances in the blood of patients who were being treated for cancer. These tests relied on 'competitive inhibition;' a compound that normally prevented growth of bacteria in culture plates no longer inhibited the growth when large amounts of Phe was present in a blood spot that was added to the plate. The birth of a niece who was found to have PKU at the age of 15 months also had an influence on his research. Since a positive ferric chloride urine test came too late to prevent her mental retardation, he became interested in developing a blood test for neonates. He had been using filter paper discs soaked in serum from the patient to be studied. He found, however, that whole blood worked equally well and facilitated newborn screening. Newborn screening with the heel stick began in 1961 and was reported by Guthrie and Susi (1963). In the first 2 years, 400,000 infants were tested in 29 states and 39 cases of PKU were found--an incidence of about 1 per 10,000. None was missed by screening. Guthrie (1996) noted that the National Association for Retarded Children through its state chapters lobbied vigorously for laws for PKU screening despite much opposition by organized medical groups; 37 states had such laws by 1967. 

Bickel (1996) described his first introduction to the disease PKU in 1949 at the University Children's Hospital Zurich where Professor G. Fanconi instructed Bickel to perform the ferric chloride test in every retarded patient. Later, on moving to the University Children's Hospital in Birmingham, he introduced the ferric chloride test there and found a patient whose mother urged him to find a way to help the daughter. Under the pressure of this mother, Bickel, Gerrard, and Hickmans (Bickel et al., 1953) speculated that there might be a causal relation between the Phe excess in the biologic fluids and the girl's brain damage and that it might be possible to improve her condition by reducing Phe intake. The use of a Phe-restricted casein hydrolysate as the main protein source of the diet was considered. Early results were dramatic. 

Early Mapping Studies

Berg and Saugstad (1974) found low positive lod scores for linkage between PKU and PGM-1, Rh, Hp, and Kell. A previous suggestion of linkage between PKU and ABO could not be confirmed. 

Kamaryt et al. (1978) studied linkage of the chromosome 1 amylase loci with PKU. Combined data for linkage with the two amylase loci yielded a lod score of 4.214 at a recombination fraction of 0.00. Paul et al. (1979) were unable to confirm linkage of PKU to chromosome 1 markers. Linkage with theta less than 0.10 was excluded for AMY2. They expressed reservations about the data of Kamaryt et al. (1978) because of the questionable accuracy of scoring AMY1 in urine and because data were used twice from a family with a parent heterozygous at both amylase loci. In this study done in Indiana, no evidence of linkage heterogeneity between Amish and non-Amish families was found.

Rao et al. (1979) derived a maximum likelihood map of chromosome 1, using data on 13 loci. They concluded that assignment of the PKU locus to chromosome 1 could be confirmed, but left as uncertain its location in the PGM1-AMY segment. Cabalska (1980) was unable, however, to confirm the linkage of chromosome 1 markers. Knapp et al. (1982) excluded close linkage between the amylase and PKU loci. They considered loose linkage unlikely. Genetic heterogeneity was considered a possible but unlikely explanation.
