Using a cDNA probe for human phenylalanine hydroxylase to analyze human-mouse hybrid cells by Southern hybridization, Lidsky et al. (1984) showed that the PAH locus is on chromosome 12 and presumably on the distal part of 12q because in hybrids containing translocated chromosome 12, it segregated with PEPB (12q21) and not with TPI (12p13). Since in family studies concordance of segregation between a mutant PAH gene and PKU was found (Woo et al., 1983), one can state that the 'PKU locus' is on chromosome 12. By in situ hybridization, the assignment of the PAH locus was narrowed to chromosome 12q22-q24.1 (Woo et al., 1984).
