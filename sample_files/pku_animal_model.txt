McDonald et al. (1990) isolated mutant mice exhibiting hereditary hyperphenylalaninemia after ethylnitrosourea mutagenesis of the germ line. By linkage mapping, they demonstrated that the disorder, which had other characteristics close to those of phenylketonuria, mapped to mouse chromosome 10 at or near the Pah locus. 

McDonald and Charlton (1997) identified a mutation within the protein coding sequence of the Pah gene in each of 2 genetic mouse models for human phenylketonuria. A genotype/phenotype relationship that was strikingly similar to the human disease emerged, underscoring the similarity of PKU in mouse and man. The enu1 mutation, induced by the chemical mutagen N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU), predicts a conservative valine-to-alanine amino acid substitution and is located in exon 3, a gene region where serious mutations are rare in humans. The phenotype in mice is mild. The second ENU-induced mutation, enu2, predicts a radical phenylalanine-serine substitution and is located in exon 7, a gene region where serious mutations are common in humans. The phenotype of the second mutation is severe. 

Martynyuk et al. (2010) reviewed the findings from animal studies on the mechanism of phenylalanine action in the PKU brain, including defects in myelin and protein synthesis, blood-brain barrier transport, direct neurotoxic effects of phenylalanine, neurotransmitter imbalances, activity of glutamate receptors, and animal behavior. 

Gersting et al. (2010) found that loss of function in Pah-enu1 mice was a consequence of misfolding, aggregation, and accelerated degradation of the enzyme. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) attenuated this triad by conformational stabilization augmenting the effective PAH concentration, which led to rescue of the biochemical phenotype and enzyme function in vivo. Combined in vitro and in vivo analyses revealed a selective pharmaceutical action of BH4 confined to the pathologic metabolic state.
