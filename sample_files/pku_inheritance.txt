Classical PKU is inherited in a strictly autosomal recessive manner and is the result of mutations in the PAH gene. Most variation in classical PKU is due to heterogeneity in the mutant alleles with many patients being compound heterozygotes rather than homozygotes for one particular mutant allele. Bartholome et al. (1984) concluded that examples of parent (usually mother)-to-child transmission of hyperphenylalaninemia are likely to be due to compound heterozygosity for PKU and HPA in either the parent or the child or both.
